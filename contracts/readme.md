This code is a Solidity contract for the cardFi platform. The contract is upgradeable and uses OpenZeppelin's ownable and initializable contracts. The contract is designed to manage the loyalty fees for a native currency and custom tokens to be added to the platform. 

The contract contains functions for initializing the contract, adding custom currencies, and setting the royalty fees for both native and custom currencies. It also contains a mapping from custom token addresses to their respective fees. Finally, there is a function to check if a token is allowed. This allows the contract to be easily managed and maintained.
